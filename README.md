# UponNYC - Volunteering Opportunities in NYC

## Overview

UponNYC provides a simple way to search for volunteering opportunities in New York City. This application uses an AngularJS front-end for a seamless single page experience and Rails backend to provide data.

New York City is home to one of the world's most largest and diverse urban populations. My goal is to provide an easy tool to bring people together and build empowering communities. If each individual provides even the smallest effort, the entire community will thrive as a whole. Together, we can make a change. Lend a hand and make a difference today.
